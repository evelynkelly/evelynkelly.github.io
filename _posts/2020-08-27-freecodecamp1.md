I've heard some very wonderful things about [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) so I've decided to give it a go and document what I learn on this blog.

Since I've set up this Jekyll blog, it should be pretty evident that I already know some of the basics, so these first few lessons don't have much to teach me.

    <h1>This is a big heading.</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph. Tags, indicated by code within pointy brackets, define the structure of a web page.</p>
    <p>Closing tags are indicated by a forward slash.</p>
    <!-- This is a comment.
    Anything within the comment will not be rendered on the web page. -->
    <p>The HTML5 specification introduces descriptive tags such as main, navbar, footer, etc. are useful for accessibility purposes. It is probably best practice to get used to using these.</p>
    <img src="example.com" alt="Don't forget to use descriptive alt text for visually-impaired users.">
    <a href="#linkable">This creates an internal link to an element with the specified id.</a>
    <p id="linkable">This is where the above link would take us.</p>
