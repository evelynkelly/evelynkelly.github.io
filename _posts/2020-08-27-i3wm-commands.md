This is a handy reference of some common i3wm commands, for anybody just starting out with i3wm.

`$mod+shift+q` quits a window (closes a window)

`$mod+d` dmenu launcher

`$mod+v` vertically tiles the next window

`$mod+h` horizontally tiles the next window

`$mod+[j,k,l,;]` changes focus in the indicated direction (i3 uses vim-like keybindings by default, but shifted one key to the right: j is left, k is down, l is up, ; is right)

`$mod+s` stack window mode

`$mod+w` tabbed window mode

`$mod+e` tiling window mode

`$mod+r` resize mode (`esc` to exit)

`$mod+shift+[j,k,l,;]` move current window in indicated direction

`$mod+shift+[0-9]` move focused window to indicated workspace

`$mod+[0-9]` switch to indicated workspace

`$mod+shift+e` exit (logout)

`$mod+shift+x` i3lock (if installed)

`$mod+shift+r` restart i3 and reload configurations
