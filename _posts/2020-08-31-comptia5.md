### Mass Storage

Logical block addressing (LBA) is a hardware-and-software interface between your operating system and mass storage devices. Since different types of mass storage use different technologies, LBA handles the translation so the operating system doesn't have to know what is actually taking place within the drive.

LBA is inherent in all operating systems and mass storage devices.

Mass storage devices count strangely because normal math uses a base-10 number system, but storage devices speak binary.

| 2<sup>x</sup> bits | Notation |
| --- | --- |
| 2<sup>10</sup> | Kibibyte |
| 2<sup>20</sup> | Mebibyte |
| 2<sup>30</sup> | Gibibyte |
| 2<sup>40</sup> | Tebibyte |
| 2<sup>50</sup> | Pebibyte |
| 2<sup>60</sup> | Exbibyte |

This discrepancy is why hard drives never seem to have the right amount of storage. Manufacturers measure sizes in decimal values, but your operating system measures them in binary.

Optical drives are 5.25" wide.

Hard disk drives are 3.5" wide.

Laptop HDDs are 2.5" wide. This form factor is also becoming popular in servers because of their compactness.

1.8" devices also exist, but did not become popular.

M.2 is the dominant SSD format.

Magnetic drives (HDDs) have sectors as the smallest unit.

Advanced technology attachment (ATA) is the "language" that hard drives use to communicate with the operating system.

Modern hard drives use serial ATA (SATA) connections, which include a power connector and a data connector.

eSATA (external SATA) exists for external drives, but USB has largely taken over due to increased speeds.
