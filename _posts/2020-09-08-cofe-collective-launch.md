I've launched a public [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instance called [Cofe Collective](https://cofecollective.club).

My goal for this instance is to provide a safe, comfortable, and welcoming environment. As the name suggests, I'd like for this instance to be cooperative and responsive to the needs of its users. Server rules will be updated to reflect our users' changing needs. Our moderation team will work hard to deal with reports in a timely and effective manner.

Since the instance is still very young, it is still a little rough around the edges. Federation is slow to backfill, so visiting profiles on other instances only shows a few of the most recent posts. The Mascot and Hero images are still generic stock photos, but we hope to have some custom art made soon. We might also experiment with custom CSS in the future to make our instance stand out a little more.

The instance is open to the public, so feel free to join and invite your friends. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, or want to help out in any way, ping me at [@eevee@cofecollective.club](https://cofecollective.club/@eevee).
