### Displays

Old displays used a 4:3 aspect ratio (like SD television).

VGA: 640x480

SVGA: 800x600 (most versions of Windows downgrade to this resolution if there are graphics issues)

SXGA: 1280x1024 (actually 5:4 but it gets lumped into this group anyway)

UXGA: 1600x1200

16:10 aspect ratio was popular for a while because it follows the golden ratio.

WSXGA: 1440x900 (lots of laptops)

UWXGA: 1920x1200 (was very popular for a while)

And then high definition television happened and changed everything. Modern displays are all 16:9 now.

720p: 1280x720 (the p stands for progressive scan, as opposed to interlaced scan), but the first displays were actually 1366x768.

QHD: 2560x1440 (popular with gamers)

1080p: 1920x1080

4k: 3840x2160

5k: 5120x2880

Do know all of these aspect ratios, as well as the history.

Multiple monitors in Windows can duplicate or extend. You can also customize the orientation of the monitors (which one is on the left or right, or even make them top and bottom).

The main display is the one with the taskbar.

### NIC Troubleshooting

Speed and duplex settings in NIC Properties.

Wake on LAN lets you wake up a PC with a wake-up packet (magic packet).

### LANs

```netstat``` shows active connections

```netstat -n``` shows numerics

```netstat -a``` shows all
